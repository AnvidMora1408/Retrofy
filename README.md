# Retrofy

Retrofy is a reimagined version of Spotify with a retro twist, blending the nostalgic aesthetics of the '90s with modern music streaming features. The design incorporates pixelated elements, vintage typography, and vibrant color palettes inspired by Spotify.

to use it you can clone the repository and run it locally with the "npm run dev" command, then you'll be able to enjoy this experience!

it works by grabbing the cassettes and dragging them to the walkman and the music will start playing!, you can pause it, skip to the next and the last one.

it  has a search bar to filter you songs.

Users can explore and enjoy a visually immersive experience that feels like a time machine to a retro era. It's the perfect mix of nostalgia and modern tech!
